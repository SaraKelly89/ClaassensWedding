Why spend a few hundred dollars having someone else create a wedding website for you when you could learn
 to do it yourself?

<br> This is the question I asked myself about 6 months ago. While some might call me "control freak" I like to think my want to personalise and create things exactly as I imagin them comes from a promise to myself as a child that I would make my dreams a reality. A stock standard Four Square site wasn't going fulfill my wedding website fantasies. So when an opportunity came up to join a group for a 10 day coding retreat at the Institute of Code in Bali, it didn't take a lot of convincing for me to pack my bags and prepare for the adventure.


<br> I had definitely hoped that this 10 day course would serve as a mini holiday while also providing me the skills I desiered. Due to the wonders of social media I am sure that from an outsiders perspective it appeared to be more outings in the monkey forest and cocktails by the pool than nerd course. I can assure you that behind the beautiful pictures were hours and hours per day spent at a computer inside looking at that pool wishfully while cursing that Bali humidity. Many late nights were spent huddled over laptops wondering how on earth we had broken our site.. this time.


 <br>The end result has been worth all the blood sweat, Bali belly and literal tears, because here it is!! A website built entirely by me! A website containing our story, our reasons for the upcoming micro wedding in Iceland, a place for us to share photos from the day as well as being flexible enough that it can be updated with stories from our honeymoon travels while we travel around Europe. Most importantly though, this site serves as the invitation for our closest friends and family to join us at our post elopement/micro wedding celebrations. To me it enables us to have the small fairytale wedding we so strongly desire while still providing a method to share this special time in our lives with the ones we love.


<br>Thank you all for being here.
